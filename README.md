# OtherMarketProductionModuleProject

Another module for recording market expenditures is a module created to assist managers in managing market expenditures in the form of building rental costs, electricity, water, and other market expenditures based on the reporting period.

Features that have been completed: Manager login feature (only managers can log in), and a reporting period display feature which, when clicked, will display a list of market expenditures based on that period. The added feature is a description of market expenditure data, and there is an edit and delete menu.

Features that need to be completed: Edit dates that are still being recorded manually, there needs to be added dates based on the correct date format.

NB: This module is only a simulation of an example module for recording market expenditures
